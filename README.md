# myschool
myschool is a web application developed using python-flask. It is being developed to be used for poor schools that don't have enough budget to create their own web. 

### Motivation
During my visit to an orphanage in my hometown I found that there were children who don't get enough exposure even though they were capable of achieving a more.

After that I visited some government schools in my hometown to know the activities performed by their students and to my surprise they were doing lot of co-curricular activities like music competition, paiting competition. Some of the students won state level competitions.   

To put information related to such activities, I decided to develop website for them. So I have started an initiative with the broad aim to help poor government schools in terms of information technology. 

This project is being developed by me for one of such schools.
